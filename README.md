# Temporary Merge Tool (tmt)

This is intended to be a tool that, in effect, allows several
git branches to be checked out at once into the same repo, with
changes committed onto a specific branch.

A use case is to try out someone else's feature branches alongside
your feature branches, without permanently tangling them together.
